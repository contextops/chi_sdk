# Commercial License Availability

This project is dual-licensed:

- Rust TUI and the prebuilt TUI binary (`chi-tui-bin`): AGPL-3.0 for public use.
- Python SDK (`chi-sdk`) and the example app: Apache-2.0.

If you want to use the TUI in a closed-source or commercial product (including SaaS) without the obligations of AGPL-3.0, a paid commercial license is available. Please contact the maintainers to discuss terms.

Contact: open an issue or reach out via the email listed in `pyproject.toml`/`Cargo.toml`.
