Task tickets for CHI-TUI. Conventions:

- One task per file, prefixed with a numeric id (zero-padded).
- Keep scope small and verifiable in a single PR.
- Use this structure:

Title: <short task name>
Status: todo | in-progress | done
Why: <problem/benefit>
Scope:
- <bullet list of changes>
Acceptance:
- <bullet list of checks>
Notes:
- <links/decisions>



Raw task convention:

inbox.RAW.md

- needs refinement
- can contain multiple topics that should go to separate tickets *.md (unless we are talking 'super small group of fixes')
