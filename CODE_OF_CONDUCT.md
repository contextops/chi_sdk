# Code of Conduct

We are committed to a friendly, safe, and welcoming environment for all.

## Our Pledge

We, as contributors and maintainers, pledge to make participation in our project and community a harassment‑free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio‑economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment include:
- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
- Focusing on what is best for the community

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:
- Harassment, insults, or derogatory comments
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others’ private information without explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Enforcement

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing standards. They may remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct, or ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors.

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the maintainers at the contact listed in `pyproject.toml`/`Cargo.toml`. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances.

This policy is adapted from the Contributor Covenant (https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) with simplifications.
